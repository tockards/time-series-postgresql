# Notes on storing time series data in PostgreSQL

## What is time series data?

> A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

I suggest reading the blog post [What the heck is time-series data ...](https://blog.timescale.com/what-the-heck-is-time-series-data-and-why-do-i-need-a-time-series-database-dcf3b1b18563) by [timescale database team](https://blog.timescale.com) as it is quite thorough and should suffice while the definition is absence from this README.
